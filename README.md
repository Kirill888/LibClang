LibClang
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chetant/LibClang.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chetant/LibClang)

LibClang is a Haskell FFI binding to libclang.

You'll need `ncurses` and a C++ compiler installed to build LibClang. On Ubuntu you can run `sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev g++` to get everything you need. On OS X it's enough to install XCode and then run `xcode-select --install`.
